# Simple js games

Some simple projects used to refresh my skills in js,
and to study how to use the [Phaser](https://phaser.io/) HTML5 game engine.

## Breakout

The breakout game.

## Platformer

2D platformer game.
In this game I tried to use class from ES6 to evaluate how good autocompletion works in VsCode for JS projects.

## How to run the games:

Host locally using an http server:
```
npm -g install http-server
cd platformer
http-server
```
and then open a browser on localhost:8080
